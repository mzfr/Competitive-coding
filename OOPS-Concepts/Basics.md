## Basics


### The Pillars of OOPS

There are 4 pillars of:

* Abstraction: Show only essential information by hiding the details.
    - Ex: steering of a car, moving it moves the car but we don't know how its happening internally.
* Encapsulation: Placing the data and function members together.
    - Ex: A capsule which hold various kind of medicines.
* Inheritences: Most important pillar. Basically can be used for code reusability.
* Polymorphism: Use a function in different ways.
    - Ex: A Man can be a father, a husband, a son at the same time.

### Some basic definition

* __Object__: It is the instance of a class which have data members and functions to perform.
* __Class__: A class is a blueprint of an object.

Below are some real life example of class and object.

- A `Vehicle` would be a class and `car, bus, truck` will be the objects.
- `Human being` is a class whereas `Man`, `women` are the object of that class.
