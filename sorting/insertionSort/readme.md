## Insertion Sort

* In insertion sort we start the sorting from 2nd element and then we just find the right position for the element.

* Hard to explain in words.

Ex:

Given array is:  [23, 45, 12, 1, 4, 5]

```
[23, 45, 12, 1, 4, 5]
[12, 23, 45, 1, 4, 5]
[1, 12, 23, 45, 4, 5]
[1, 4, 12, 23, 45, 5]
[1, 4, 5, 12, 23, 45]

Sorted array is:  [1, 4, 5, 12, 23, 45]
```
