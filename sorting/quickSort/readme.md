## Quick Sort

* In quick sort the basic idea is that you pick a pivot element from the array and then place that element at the correct position at which it will belong in the sorted array.
    - Also once the pivot element is placed you put all the element smaller than pivot to its left and all the greater elements to its right.

* This pivot methodolgy is called partition function. There are some ways multiple ways to implement this partition function.
