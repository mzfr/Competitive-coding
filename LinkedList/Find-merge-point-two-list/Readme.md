## Find the merge point of two linked list

__URL__: https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/find-the-merge-point-of-two-joined-linked-lists/problem

## Solution

So we start with the two pointer approach. One pointer point to the head of List1 and another pointer points to the head of List2. Now we increment both of them and while doing that we check if they are not equal(break if they are).

In the end we return the value in the first pointer.
